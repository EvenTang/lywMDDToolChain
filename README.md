# lywMDDToolChain

To do list for V1.2:
- [ ] Generate State Chart based on the information of sequence (events/states)
- [ ] Create a STM generator. (High priority)
- [ ] Add proto file analyzer to a complete .proto analysis so that API file can be generated completely.

Release plan for future ( I don't know when )

- [ ] Create a exchange data file(Maybe xml) for ERBCodeGenerator/SequenceAnalyzer

      this file could be a data exchange center of ERBCodeGenerator/SequenceAnalyzer/GPB/Matlab


- [ ] Change all parsers to context-free grammars parser (Low priority)
